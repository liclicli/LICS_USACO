##Contact
The contact.c uses the AVL-binary Tree technique to address a O(NlogN) solution.
However, it is still too slow to AC this problem.
Another try in contact1.c is using dictionary tree and deque to employ a BFS.
Oh, this problem is ACed finally. Both two algorithms work for this problem, but the dictionary tree is faster.
#Remember, dont use strlen(char \*) for a loop end because it will be calculated always.
